## What you will do
Download the development tools and the software for the first sample application for Raspberry Pi 3. If you have any problems, look for solutions on the [troubleshooting page](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-troubleshooting.md).

## What you will learn
In this article, you will learn:

* How to install Git and Node.js.
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com) is an open source distributed version control system. The sample application for this article is stored on Git.
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime with a rich package ecosystem.
* How to use NPM to install additional Node.js development tools.
  * The minimum version requirement of Node.js is 4.5 LTS.
  * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) is one of the package managers for Node.js.

## What you need
To complete this operation, you will need:

* An Internet connection to download the development tools and the software.
* A computer that is running Windows.

## Install Git and Node.js
Click the following links to download and install Git and Node.js LTS for Windows.

* [Get Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win/)
* [Get Node.js LTS for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Install additional Node.js development tools
Use [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) to automate the deployment of the sample application to Pi. You also use the [device-discovery-cli](https://github.com/Azure/device-discovery-cli) to retrieve network information about your IoT devices.

Start a command prompt as an administrator. Install `gulp` and `device-discovery-cli` by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g device-discovery-cli gulp
```

If you experience issues installing Node.js and these additional Node.js development tools on your computer, see the [troubleshooting guide](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-troubleshooting.md) for solutions to common problems.

## Install Visual Studio Code
[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) and install Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You use this editor later in the tutorial to edit the sample code.

## Summary
You've installed the required development tools and software for the first sample application. The next task is to create, deploy, and run the sample application on Pi.
